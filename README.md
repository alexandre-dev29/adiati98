## About Me
<br>🌱 I’m currently enrolling in **Scrimba: The Frontend Developer Career Path**.
<br> 📝 You can find me learning in public on my [Blog](https://adiati.com/), and let's connect via [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@ayuadiati), [DEV](https://dev.to/adiatiayu) or [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/adiatiayu)!
<br>:sparkles: I would having my ***DSLR camera*** on my hands, chewing ***sushi*** or watching ***movie*** when I'm not coding or chasing my daughter or doing house chores.

⚡ **Fun fact**
<br>🗣: I speak 4 languages - Indonesian, English, Dutch and Japanese.
<br>☕ I always enjoy my **ICE** Machiatto Latte, whether it's summer or winter!
<br>:sparkling_heart: I always consider *learning* as one of my hobby. Getting my brain to work to solve problems makes me feel alive and coming out with solution could make me do my happy feet :penguin:

❤ My favorite quote:
