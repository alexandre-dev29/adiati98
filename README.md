<br>‚ö° **Fun fact**
<br>üó£ I speak 4 languages - Indonesian, English, Dutch and Japanese.
<br>:sparkles: I would having my ***DSLR camera*** on my hands, chewing ***sushi*** or watching ***movie*** when I'm not coding or chasing my daughter or doing house chores.
<br>‚òï I always enjoy my **ICE** Machiatto Latte, whether it's summer or winter!
<br>üìö I consider *learning* as one of my hobby. Getting my brain to work to solve problems makes me feel alive and coming out with solution could make me do my happy feet :penguin:

‚ù§ My favorite quote:
> Knowledge changes you and so often you can't go back.
> Whether is about people, life or about yourself, there is only going forward from it.
