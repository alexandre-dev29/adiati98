<br>⚡ **Fun fact**
<br>🗣: I speak 4 languages - Indonesian, English, Dutch and Japanese.
<br>:sparkles: I would having my ***DSLR camera*** on my hands, chewing ***sushi*** or watching ***movie*** when I'm not coding or chasing my daughter or doing house chores.
<br>☕: I always enjoy my **ICE** Machiatto Latte, whether it's summer or winter!
<br>📚 I always consider *learning* as one of my hobby. Getting my brain to work to solve problems makes me feel alive and coming out with solution could make me do my happy feet :penguin:
<br>When I don't get solution yet? Refer back to ☕:point_up_2:

❤ My favorite quote:
