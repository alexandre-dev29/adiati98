# Helloww 👋


<br>:raising_hand: I'm Ayu, an Indonesian based in The Netherlands. I am a stay home mom who happily get my feet wet in programming world.

<br> 📝 You can find me learning in public on my [Blog](https://adiati.com/), and let's connect via [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@ayuadiati), [DEV](https://dev.to/adiatiayu) or [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/adiatiayu)!
<br>🌱 I’m currently enrolling in **Scrimba: The Frontend Developer Career Path**.
<br>:sparkles: I would having my DSLR :camera: on my hands, chewing :sushi: or watching movie when I'm not 👩‍💻 or chasing my :girl: or doing :house: chores.

<br>⚡ Fun fact: 

<br>🗣: I speak 4 languages - Indonesian, English, Dutch and Japanese.
<br>:green_heart: I always enjoy my **COLD** Machiatto Latte :coffee:!
<br>:sparkling_heart: I always consider *learning* as one of my hobby. Getting my brain to work to solve problems makes me feel alive and coming out with solution could make me do my happy feet :penguin:
<br>When I don't get solution yet? Refer back to :green_heart::point_up_2:

My favorite quote:
