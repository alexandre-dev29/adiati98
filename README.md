<br>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolling in **Scrimba: The Frontend Developer Career Path** (September 2020) & **Flavio Javascript Fullstack Online Bootcamp** (July 2020).

<br>:sparkles: I would having my DSLR :camera: on my hands, chewing :sushi: or watching movie when I'm not coding or chasing my :girl: or doing :house: chores.

<br>:green_heart: I always enjoy my **COLD** Caramel Latte :coffee:!
<br>
<br>:sparkling_heart: I always consider *learning* as one of my hobby. Getting my brain to work to solve problems makes me feel alive and coming out with solution could make me do my happy feet :penguin:
